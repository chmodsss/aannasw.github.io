*Vanakkam*\_/\\\_ I'm Sivasurya Santhanam, usually go by Siva for making everyone's life easier.

Born and brought up in southern part of India, I pursued my undergrad in Mechatronics Engineering. Unsatisfied with the Engineering skills, I favoured for research. I came to Germany to pursue Masters of science in Autonomous systems. The transition from being an Engineer to a researcher was hard yet exciting.

I am currently a NLP(Natural language processing) researcher in German Aerospace Center(DLR) at Cologne. As a researcher at DLR, I have the opportunity to research and develop cool Natural language processing tools to be applied in intelligent-assistive systems for software engineering. My research focuses on applying the power of machine learning algorithms in NLP to build systems with better Natural language understanding. Currently building Conversational AI for Developers.

I co-organise a monthly [PyData meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Cologne-Bonn/) in Cologne-Bonn. Feel free to contact me if you wanna give a talk or host an event.

*Wanna work with me?* Check out our the [jobs](https://www.dlr.de/dlr/jobs/en/#Koeln/SimulationsSoftwaretechnik) at our department

I am good with *python*, numpy, sklearn & potato curry. My recent crush is playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/sss107)(blitz & bullets). I also read [fictions](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23440337-sivasurya). I write ML/AI based articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@chmodsss). I also co-write some really unpopular fiction stories along with a good friend of mine [Harish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harishkarthinatarajan/) under the pen-name [Tale Mongers](https://medium.com/@talemongers2)
